1~J. Murrey Atkins Library~Atkins Library~Atkins Library, the third building to be constructed on the UNC Charlotte campus, is named for J. Murrey Atkins, the son of a prominent Gastonia family, successful Charlotte businessman and one of the University’s founding members. Atkins, born in Russellville, Ky., graduated from Gastonia High School. At Duke University, he served as editor of the yearbook and earned a bachelor’s degree in 1927. He attended Harvard Law School and Columbia University and spent five years in New York with the Irving Trust Co. before returning to Charlotte. In 1935, he joined the city’s leading investment firm R.S. Dickson and Co., where he was president from 1954 until his death. Atkins was involved with Charlotte College from its inception. He was chair of the college advisory committee for eight years and chair of the Charlotte Community College System when it was authorized in 1958. When UNC Charlotte became a four-year college, he served as chair of the board of trustees. Sensitive to the social and educational needs of the community, Atkins believed that the Charlotte region needed a public institution of higher learning to stay competitive with other cities in the state. He used his business, financial and political contacts to help Charlotte College become that institution. “Charlotte College was started to meet an emergency and has continued as a necessity,” Atkins was fond of saying. Charlotte College shared a library facility with Central High School. Mozelle Scherger was hired as the first full-time librarian in 1957, when a daytime instructional program was launched. When the college was formally accredited that fall, the number of volumes in the library exceeded 6,000. Atkins believed the library should be central on the campus, central in student service and the very focal point of learning. When the library was first moved to the new campus, it was temporarily housed in the W. A. Kennedy Building. The pioneering leader would not live to see the current library adorned with his name. He died Dec. 2, 1963, and the J. Murrey Atkins Library was dedicated on April 19, 1965. The state legislature appropriated $20.5 million for an expansion in 1995.~35.30582877~-80.73241989~1

3~Bascom Weaver Barnard Building~Barnard~Bascom “Barney” Weaver Barnard established the Charlotte College Foundation and served as its first chair. His name features prominently in the early years of UNC Charlotte, and it adorns an 18000-square-foot building completed in 1969, designed to serve as a facility for instruction and research. Born Feb. 14 1894 Barnard was a native of Asheville. He graduated from Trinity College (now Duke University) and completed a master’s degree from Princeton University in 1917. He returned to his alma mater, where he taught economics and served as alumni secretary and graduate manager of athletics until 1922. He eventually left academia for the private sector. barnard Starting in 1939 Barnard worked as an executive for American Commercial Bank (later NCNB now Bank of America), American Discount Company and the American Credit Corporation while maintaining a busy roster of civic activities. He served on the board the Family and Children Service the Salvation Army and as chair of the National Affairs Committee of the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce. In 1966 he received one of Charlotte’s highest civic honors - the Civitan Distinguished Citizenship Award. In that same year Barnard founded Charlotte College Foundation which by 1971 had raised $4.5 million for the fledgling University; since then the foundation has since raised significantly more to support scholarship and academic programming at UNC Charlotte. He served as the foundation’s secretary and executive director and established the University’s Patrons of Excellence Program which solicited gifts of $10000 or more from individuals foundations and corporations. On May 30 1971 the UNC Charlotte Academic Council presented Barnard with a resolution stating “Scholarships professorships research grants additions to the library collection faculty recruitment – all these and more have flourished at his hand. In short he has helped to provide the margin that leads to excellence.” Barnard died Sept. 27, 1980.~35.30580826~-80.73006041~1
4~Thomas Milburn Belk Gym~Belk Gym~Belk Gym is a bigger better facility now than when it was first constructed in 1970. One of the oldest buildings on campus Belk Gym houses recreational and academic opportunities for students. The 130000-square-foot structure originally cost the University $3281000 to build; in 2014, the facility underwent renovations to accommodate the University’s much-larger student population. The $17.1 million project added air conditioning for the facility and reconfigured spaces for the fitness center and cycling studio. The Recreational Services Department manages the overall facility, which includes the fitness center and weight room; cycling and group fitness studios; basketball, volleyball and racquetball courts; and academic spaces. The department also programs the group fitness classes, sport clubs and intramural sports activities. Belk Gym also houses the Department of Kinesiology. Historically Belk Gym has been an important physical fitness area for students. Affectionately known to some as “The Mine Shaft,” Belk Gym was once home to the Charlotte 49ers basketball and women’s volleyball teams. In 1977 Charlotte advanced to the Final Four of the NCAA basketball tournament and the men’s basketball team began playing at the city’s two Charlotte coliseums. Today the men’s and women’s basketball teams and women’s volleyball play home games at Halton Arena. Thomas Milburn Belk for whom the gym is named was the youngest child of William Henry Belk and Mary Irwin Belk. He was born Feb. 6 1925 in Charlotte and died Jan. 25 1997. William Belk founder of department store chain Belk Inc. left the business to his children when he died in 1952. A natural leader Tom Belk served as president of the retail chain. He and John Belk led the company’s growth from discount merchandiser to what became the largest privately owned department store in the nation. Belks attention to details made him an outstanding fundraiser. He led efforts for Charlotte YMCAs UNC Chapel Hill and UNC Charlotte. As one of Charlotte’s most admired businessmen and civic leaders Tom Belk was committed to giving back to the Charlotte community. He served in key leadership roles for a number of civic educational and charitable causes. Belk attended Davidson College before joining the U.S. Navy during World War II. He later returned to study at UNC Chapel Hill where he graduated in 1948 from the School of Commerce with a bachelor’s degree. His wife Katherine taught in Charlotte public schools. Both Katherine and Tom Belk worked to improve education in North Carolina. Together, they rendered consistent financial and leadership support to UNC Charlotte. In 1958, Belk was named a member of the Charlotte Community College Board. From 1963 to 1965 he was a member of the Charlotte College Board of Trustees and later became chairman. Katherine and Tom Belk’s financial support was among the earliest and most significant gifts that UNC Charlotte received. In 1987 UNC Charlotte awarded Thomas Belk an honorary Doctorate of Public Service degree.~35.30542519~-80.73547054~1

6~Sherman Burson Building~Burson~Sherman Burson Jr. was the first Charles Stone Professor of Chemistry and the inaugural dean of the-then College of Arts and Sciences. A native of Pittsburgh, Pa., Burson was born Christmas Eve 1923. His father, a Methodist minister, moved the family to Massachusetts, where Burson graduated from Harwich High School. Uncertain of his career goals, Burson considered becoming a surgeon, psychologist or medical researcher. With little money for college, Burson took the advice of his high school principal and moved South where college costs were lower. He spent the 1941-42 academic year at the University of Alabama. When money ran out, he returned to Pennsylvania, where he worked in a steel mill during the day and attended the University of Pittsburgh at night.  World War II was under way, and Burson entered the U.S. Army. A special program enabled him to continue studies at Louisiana State University; following the war, he returned to the University of Pittsburgh, where he completed a bachelor’s degree in chemistry. He earned a doctorate in 1953. sherman bursonIn 1957, after nearly five years in private industry, Burson decided to pursue a career in academia. He joined the faculty of Pfeiffer College in Misenheimer. At the urging of Charlotte College founder Bonnie Cone, Burson accepted a position at the institution. He was a professor of chemistry and chair of the department when Charlotte College became the fourth campus of the University of North Carolina in 1965. It was under Burson that the department achieved accreditation from the American Chemical Society. UNC Charlotte’s first chancellor, Dean Colvard, appointed Burson acting dean of the College of Science and Mathematics in 1973, and in 1980, Chancellor E.K. Fretwell named him dean of the newly formed College of Arts and Sciences (now the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences), formed by the merger of the College of Science and Mathematics with the College of Humanities and the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences. Burson held this post until retiring in June 1985. He died Dec. 3, 2012. Completed in summer 1985, the Sherman L. Burson Building was originally dedicated as the Physical Sciences Building. The 104,000-square-foot facility includes a 184-seat tiered lecture hall, a number of smaller lecture halls and laboratory space. Designed by Peterson Associates of Charlotte, the building was constructed by Butler and Sidbury Inc. for a little more than $8 million. At the time of its re-dedication in April 1999, the building was noted for its planetarium platform mounted on vibration-resistant pedestals, an underground Van de Graaf linear accelerator in the basement and reinforced concrete radiation labs. The building’s design won a national architectural award and was included in the American School and Universities Architectural Portfolio for 1986.~35.30743151~-80.73232125~1
